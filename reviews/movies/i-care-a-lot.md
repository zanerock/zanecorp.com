This is probably somewhat personal, but I had a really visceral reaction to this movie. Watching the movie, I was angry and, to be honest, wanted nothing more than the main character to die. It's the story of con artist Marla Grayson (Rosamund Pike) who, with the help of a crooked doctor and an all to credulous judge, gets elderly citizens declared wards of the state due to supposed inability to care for themselves. She then gets herself appointed as their guardian and uses that position to drain their life savings. In so doing, she must isolate the individuals from their friends and family "for their own good" and thus creating a truly dystopian nightmare situation that at the same time feels all to plausible.[^1]

[^1]: Plausible enough for a movie at least. Not that such a thing doesn't happen at the fringes, but in reality, this would be a very hard scheme to pull off at any scale. The situation with the elderly lady at the center of the movie does feel a bit more plausible as they establish that she has no legally recognized family and no friends to speak of.

Maria and her business partner and lover, Fran (Eiza González) take on more than they bargain for when their latest whale of a mark, Jennifer Peterson (Dianne West)—whom they believe to have no family or friends—turns out to be the Mother of an infamous mob boss, Roman Lunyov (played by Peter Dinklage). The main narrative focuses on the escalating game of cat-and-mouse between Maria and Roman as the latter tries to rescue his Mother and the former seeks to retain control.

Though it focuses mainly on the struggle between the two power players, I'm pretty sure the whole thing is, in part, a satire on the rich and powerful and their undo influence over lives of us regular folk. It's really a villains tale, as it focuses on the entirely unlikable Maria, with Roman playing the slightly more sympathetic foil who is also ultimately a pretty terrible person. (My favorite character is the red headed underling Alexi Ignatyev (Nicholas Logan.)

The movie does a pretty good job of keeping you guessing how it's going to end without resorting to unreliable narration or unexplained plot points. It's well constructed, well directed, and has excellent acting. I wouldn't call it entertaining, though that's not really the purpose. For most people, it probably won't strike quite the chord it did with me, but I would bet the majority of viewers will find this to be a pretty impactful movie.

  <summary>At the end of the movie...</summary>

So, at the start of the movie, when we see the son of the only other victim we actually see in anything more than as a picture on the wall trying to win back his Mother's freedom, I was pretty sure he'd end up shooting her in the end. Then, I thought maybe the karmic justice that the movie seemed to cry out for would be delivered by Roman. When that turned out not to be the case and Roman and Maria teemed up, I thought "well, shit, she's going to get away with it" and experienced a fresh wave of anger. But then when they started the montage and music in the final moments, I was like, "Oh, the son is going to pop up and take her out just as everything goes right." And he did.

Which did sorta fulfill the "justice" angle of the movie, while also allowing the larger point of the rich and powerful to continue since the company she formed with Roman would, one would assume, continue on. It was actually pretty well balanced in that regard. Still, it doesn't make one feel "good" by any means. But, that's the point really.
