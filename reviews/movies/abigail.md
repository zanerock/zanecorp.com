A group of criminals is brought together to kidnap a little rich girl for $50 mil in ransom. All they have to do is hang out in some creepy old house until the money shows up. If you haven't seen the trailer, don't. It totally ruins the reveal.

  <summary>If you have seen the trailer, I don't give anything else away here.</summary>

So then after a bit all the doors lock and shutters clang shut on all the windows. The little rich girl, Abigail (Alisha Weir) is revealed to be a vampire and all hell breaks loose.

It's a pretty good movie and a nice twist on the vampire genre. The set up is a bit convoluted though. Like, I get that the baby vampire gets bored after however long she's been alive and like wants to hunt people, and it makes sense for her to do so in a known environment and what not. But why set up the whole kidnapping thing thing seems a bit overly complicated.

Maybe she likes to play with her food a bit or something, but IDK. Her first kill is in secret (which sets everyone off), but if the goal was some extended mind fuck, then why not continue to play innocent and pick everyone off one by one? I think extending the reveal a bit and leaving everyone to wonder what was going on, maybe turning them against each other and such would have made for a bit more interesting movie IMO.
