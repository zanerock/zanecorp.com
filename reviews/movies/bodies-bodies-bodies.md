This is a fun murder mystery featuring a group of highly privileged, a guy in his 30s, and a more down to earth exchange student gather together for a hurricane party. Trapped in the house by mother nature, things get all to real when, while playing "Bodies Bodies Bodies"â€”a game where the designated "killer" murders someone when the lights go out, the douchiest member of the group pops up and bleeds out in front of everyone. Teen drama and strained relationships are heightened to the max as everyone scrambles to try and figure out who they can trust and who the murderer might be.

This is a fun, relatively original twist that successfully blends the murder mystery thriller with the teen movie and a dash of horror. There are some critical instances of unreliable narration that weaken the impact of the final reveal, and hurt the quality and entertainment of the movie a bit. <span class="major-spoiler">Specifically, when the one girl dies by falling down the stairs and we're led to believe she was being pursued and pushed, which is fine in-itself, but the amount of blood and gore that accompanies her falling down the stairs is ridiculous and certainly implies that there must have been a slasher type murder because of all the arterial spray covering the walls. They really should have kept the scene consistent with what is ultimately revealed as the truth.</span>
