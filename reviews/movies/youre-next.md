A straightforward horror-thriller that skips the foreplay and gets right too it. TBH, one of the best slasher style horror films I've seen. It's non-stop screams and blood and murder with excellent pacing, a few twists, and a legitimately sympathetic main character. It's a rare movie that's cinematic, dramatic, and lacks any silly plot points. Yeah, things come together "just so" to make the narrative, but there's no unreliable narrator or trickery in the plot.

I really appreciated the camera work and visual tone. There's a slightly grainy warmth to the film and a lot of hand-held that makes the visuals feel a bit more authentic, without feeling jumpy or over-processed. The dialog and characters are simple and straightforward. There are even a few instances of dark, dead-pan humor that blend in nicely with everything without standing out too much or feeling forced.

  <summary>It has so many classic horror/slasher elements without feeling forced or overdone.</summary>

I really appreciated the "it's coming from inside the house" twist mid-way through. It really makes the movie work in two parts and pivots the narrative just enough—while still keeping everything consistent—to keep things from becoming to repetitive and give a slightly different flavor to the second half of the movie.

At just over 90 minutes, it's even a classic horror movie length. I'd put it right up there with Friday the 13th as a real epitome of the genre.
