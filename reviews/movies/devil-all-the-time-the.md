True to it's title, this movie is just a series of tragic, heartbreaking events. From a fucked up childhood <span class="moderate-spoiler">that culminates in his Mother's death from cancer and his Father's suicide</span>, to a fucked up adolescence <span class="moderate-spoiler">culminating in the not-quite but still deadly suicide of his sister</span>, the only thing you can really say about the main character, Arvin (Tom Holland), is that he lives through it all.

The movie is pretty impactful on some levels. The sheer weight of human tragedy that heaps upon the main character can't help but stir sympathy and pangs. The problem with the movie, though, is that it doesn't really do anything with it. Maybe that's the point... maybe the idea is "that's just how life is sometimes", but even then, I don't know, the main character seems uniquely cursed to just endure tragedy after tragedy with no respite or hope. Because the pattern is established fairly early, I don't feel I'm giving anything away to say that the movie is entirely devoid of redemption, has no call to action, it's just misery and sadness.

Which again, artistically you could say the movie is powerful in a way. But even there, I have some issues. Specifically, the time between 1957 when Arvin goes to live with his aunt, uncle, and adoptive sister Lenora (Eliza Scanlen) and when we pick the story back up in 1965, it would have  been interesting to establish a relatively happy period in counterpoint to all the misery. It's implied that his aunt and uncle are good people, and at the very least, his time with them was uneventful, and to have seen some part of that—a scene or two, maybe a montage—would have accentuated the following tragedies and given Arvin's character more purpose.

IDK. It's certainly not a fun or entertaining movie. It's well done, so I wouldn't call it bad. And maybe there's some value in an "unvarnished look at misery" or something. But that's as much as I can say for it.
