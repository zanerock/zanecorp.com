Based on a [Texas Monthly article](https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/hit-man-2/) by Skip Hollandsworth, Hit Man is the tale of a university professor and part time supplier of listening devices who is thrust into the role of playing a hit man in an absurd number of sting operations by New Orleans PD. The movie itself is essentially an interesting twist on the rom-com as our protagonist Gary (Glen Powell) ends up undermining one of his sting operations and advising Madison (Adria Arjona) to forgo killing her husband. He then extremely problematically dates her, still in the guise of the hit man.

All in all, I don't mind the hit man conceit. It's ridiculous to think that there are so many attempted hits going on that you could have a full time unit tasked with nothing but near constant sting operations, but honestly it's a fine conceit. It makes the character more interesting and sets up the rest of the (entirely fictional) part of the story.

The first part of the film is interesting mainly for all the characters that Gary plays in order to become each would be client's idealized version of a hit man. Then, the middle part where Gary woos Madison and they embark on their extremely problematic affair is actually pretty boring, and honestly, not all that necessary. It could have been condensed by at least half without losing anything.

The end gets interesting again, with the most interesting scene—IMO—coming when Gary has to get Madison off the hook while pretending to tray and entrap her, and all the while Madison has no information on what's going on. It's pretty slick. And the end of the movie is also pretty interesting, with some very unexpected, interesting, and dark turns.

The end really rescues the movie from being an absolute nothing-burger. The problem is, the build up to it is unnecessarily long and I'm not sure it's worth it. There's just too much filler in the movie. As mentioned, it spends way to long on the romance which, once established, is pretty cut and dry. The whole "university professor" bit is entirely unnecessary and distracting and really feels shoehorned in.[^1] They try to justify it by using it as a vehicle for some sort of meta-commentary on morality, but it really doesn't work. Indeed, the last little "university prof exposition" scene is just word salad.

[^1]: I strongly suspect that what happened was they started with the true story from the Texas Monthly article about an actual university professor who did end up working for the cops in sting operations (involving drugs, not hits, of course). So, they started with that and then tried to spice it up, but ended kinda getting stuck with the prof angle. By the time they were done, all the interesting bits of the story were entirely fictional and they probably felt they had to keep the prof bit in so as to have some tangential connection with the real life dude that originally sparked their interest.

<div class="major-spoiler">
  <summary>The end, is actually really strong though.</summary>

The eventually entanglement and unraveling of the affair is interesting (though there's some filler there as well). And I really liked Jasper (Austin Amelio), the crooked cop who pushes the action at the end. It's neat how Gary outsmarts him when he tries to corner him and expose his relationship with Madison, and then when he shows up again for some straight blackmail, it drives Gary to actually become a killer. That's actually pretty interesting, unexpected, and also believable (within the narrative framework). That's hard to pull off and if the movie had just focused more on the interesting bits, it could have been really good.

</div>

In the end, we have a movie with some interesting bits and a lot of filler. The end does a lot to redeem, but you have to spend way to much time to get there. And the frustrating part is it's totally unnecessary. You could literally just cut scenes, without re-filming anything or changing the story at all, and drop maybe 20 min of dead weight. Like, the epilogue at the end with future Gary and his family was 100% unnecessary. I'm not even sure what the point was supposed to be. It's the filler-est part of an artificially stuffed movie. If I had to guess, they wanted it to feel more like a rom-com, and then have their twist at the end. But it doesn't really work. I don't usually comment on other rating, but the Rotten Tomatoes rating of 95% (as of 2024-09-06) is absolutely inexplicable to me. My guess is that people are giving way to much credit to the end, maybe because Linklater is involved so they assume it must be good? IDK.
