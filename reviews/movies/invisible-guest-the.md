# The Invisible Guest

</trigger-warning>

A man holes up with his lawyer, recounting the events that led to the murder of his lover, starting with the negligent homicide of a young man. What follows is a tale of callous entitlement and indifference to the suffering of others.

The only question, besides which character is less sympathetic, is who knows what and whose manipulating who in this rather well put together mystery thriller. <span class="major-spoiler">Though relatively straightforward, the reveal at the end is a nice little twist.</span> It's a nice, relatively low-key and not-to-complicated mystery thriller.
