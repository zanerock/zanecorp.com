# Flamin Hot

<DocTags basePath="reviews" tags={ frontMatter.tags } />
<Ratings ratings={ frontMatter.ratings } />

Since this movie goes out of it's way to tell you that it's a true story, I feel compelled to make clear at the outset, [that it's not](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/movies/flamin-hot-true-story.html); see also [this pre-movie expose by the LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-05-16/flamin-hot-cheetos-richard-montanez). Setting that aside, it's a relatively successful feel-good story about the little guy overcoming life's obstacles of systemic racism and classism to rise to the top through hard work and perseverance.

It would be better, though, if they hadn't pushed the "true story" aspect so much, because now, I just can't help but compare. In reality, Frito Lay (not sure when they were bought by PepsiCo) is a bit more sympathetic in the story and Montañez's (Jesse Garcia) rise through the company ranks was a lot more iterative and normal than portrayed in the film. Rather than being held back for years, the real Montañez did become a machine operator a couple years after starting.

Which brings up one flaw in the movie narrative, in that the Frito-Lay CEO, Roger Enrico (Tony Shalhoub) is supposed to be a sympathetic character who really sees beyond all the "local politics" that hold Montañez back... except as CEO of the company, he's directly responsible for all the policies and culture that hold Montañez in the film. (Which, again, in real life, didn't exist.) This makes Montañez's faith in Enrico feel misplaced and Enrico's championing of the underdog out of step with the other information the film is showing us.

Setting aside all that complication, though, the story on it's own is a rather uncomplicated everyman tale. The tale is straightforward, simple, and endearing. If anything, my only complaint is the main character is so sincere and un-jaded as to seem naive. Like, he should be a bit cynical and angry at the world and his situation. And in the larger sense, the story of "hard work eventually gets rewarded, even in the face of explicit racism and classism" is just so untrue as to be a little dangerous. It's a individually heroic and inspiring tale, but the systemic implications, especially combined with the utter dishonesty of the premise, ends up feeling a bit manipulative.
