This is an interesting movie that—if you don't know anything about it going in—takes a lot of unexpected turns. It moves along pretty briskly and is entertaining to watch. I really enjoyed the way the story unfolded and grew richer as the movie progressed, though as far as this review goes it does make it hard to say much without giving something away.

The plot is very cleverly constructed with a lot of attention to detail. Once you accept the basic fantastical aspects as given, there's not really anything serious (except maybe one point) that doesn't go unexplained or ultimately fitting together.

  <summary>Wherein I discuss the plot.</summary>

I enjoyed how at first, it's just like they're stuck on a creepy boat. I assumed it was haunted or something and the movie would just be the characters getting killed off. So, when everyone but Jess dies about a third of the way in, I was like "Now what?" Is the whole rest of the movie just Jess running from the killer?

That's when we get our first loop and Jess sees the capsized ship she arrived on arrive again. At first it seems she has a chance to change things and possibly save everyone. There were actually multiple points where I thought Jess might be changing things and that maybe it was possible to escape, but then the inevitability of it all starts to sink in. For me, the scene with all the dead Sally's on the upper deck was what really drove it home. (Which was a really good scene, BTW.)

They kinda get you again at the end, because, I thought, maybe by escaping the boat, Jess escapes the loop. Of course, then the whole thing is revealed to be one huge loop and it starts all over again. At first, I thought the end was a bit off because I thought Jess needed to survive the crash so she could loop through again. After reading I realized that (duh), Jess died in the crash, which was the original catalyst for everything, and the Jess looking at the crash is like her spirit and the whole thing an afterlife punishment (or consequence) of Jess's inability to accept she's dead and that she killed her son.

Which brings us to the one thing in the movie that seems like a plot hole: why doesn't Jess remember all this? It is a necessary liberty to make the concept work, but I think with all the trauma, it makes sense. When Jess is napping on the boat at the beginning of the movie and wakes up, I think she even says something about a bad dream she can't remember. Whether magically or psychologically, that's the point where she resets.

One small note: I'm not sure the point of the Heather character (the lady Sally is trying to hook up Greg). Though it is funny how no one but Sally seems at all concerned with her death in the storm.
