This is one of the tensest movies I've seen in quite a while. Even more so than, as far as I recall, the other movies in the series.

Like all Alien movies, you know a single female is going to survive at the end and the most interesting character is going to be the obligatory replicant. In this particular iteration, that plays out as a group of youths, economically trapped on a polluted, corrupt mining colony, board the Romulus in order to salvage the cryo-pods they'll need to make the long journey to another star system in order to escape their fate. Of course, once on board, things go sideways, the face huggers are released, and things go downhill from there.

The movie does a good job of setting the scene and tone of the Alien universe as a kind of grungy, cyberpunk far future that feels like the 80's, but with ubiquitous space ships and replicants. The mis-matched tech level that simultaneously features fully humanoid, hyper-intelligent super bots alongside analog screens and manually piloted space craft is of course ridiculous, but that's the universe, so I'm fine with it. This particular tale, though is riddled with impossible plot points and unforced plausibility errors that can be a bit distracting and ultimately cost the movie some points on quality and entertainment.

<details class="minor-spoiler">
  <summary>Plausibility errors such as...</summary>

Ok, the first major is that the company is just letting this super-expensive space station, which they are fully aware contains the research and bio-material whose retrieval is like the whole point of multiple other Alien movies, that they're going to just let all that full into the rings of the planet and be destroyed? It's ridiculous. They really needed to do some work on why the company was ignoring the station, or maybe why the local company officials were unaware of it, or something. Or, have a company rescue crew operating in parallel with the kids. That would have been cool. But, if that had been the only thing, I could chalk it up to lazy setup and movie on.

But the second plausibility error is just laughable. So, the baby alien (after an unusually short growth period) is busts out of the chest on the kid's borrowed ship, causing the pilot to bump the controls and the ship to just fly out of control. As the completely uncontrolled ship hurtles through space at unsafe speeds and random directions, it just happens to fly into a docking bay and more or less safely land and, apparently, dock with Romulus? Absolutely absurd. And, an entirely unforced error as you could have easily had some sort of auto-pilot in the ship or auto-docking protocol driven by Romulus.

The other thing that really irked me was when they were preparing to enter the other side of the space station, in order to get to their ship, and they had to walk through the room filled with space huggers. They establish the huggers can't see, but are very sensitive to sound and heat. They go out of their way to explain that even goose bumps or a bit of stress could change you body temp enough for them to notice. So, they set the room temperature to 98.6 and quietly sneak in...

Except 1) 98.6 is an average, not an exact law. Your body temp fluctuates naturally by a couple degrees throughout the day. 2) That's a core body temp. The surface temperature of your skin is much lower. 3) Heat is not distributed evenly throughout your body. Your head is generally warmer and your extremities a bit cooler. 4) Even assuming your body is an even 98.6 degrees at all points, they went in wearing their fucking clothes and clearly sweating. _And then_, in the end, none of it mattered. The huggers were alerted to their presence because Tyler (Archie Renaux) takes a fucking call in the middle everything. After spending all this time setting up the heat sensing capabilities of the face huggers, it didn't play into the narrative at all. Maybe they were trying to stick to established lore or something (though I don't remember this being established before), but really, they could have just left the heat sensing stuff out entirely. Amazing.

That being said, the whole early sequence with the two boys trapped in the bio lab and everyone trying to get them out, and the ship going out of control was really good. Very tense, high emotions, lots of actions. It was maybe the highlight of the movie.

</details>

Overall, though, the scenes really do work and the movie does a really good job of keeping you in a constant state of tension while moving the narrative along and, for the most part, believably so. If it were cleaned up a bit, I would say there would be a strong argument to be made that this is the best Alien movie yet. As it is, I'd put it solidly in third, behind the original and Aliens.
