Lisa Frankenstein aims to be a rom-com with a twist, and/or a critique of the genre perhaps. It's the story of Lisa Swallows (Kathryn Newton) whose morbid fascination with the dead leads her to form a one-sided relationship with a young man with a tragic past interned in the local cemetery. Then, one night while at a party, a bolt of lightning resurrects the young man in classic Frankenstein style, who then makes his way to Lisa's house and breaks in. After an initial bit of terror, Lisa recognizes the young man in zombie form and sets about cleaning and socializing him.

    Over the course of the movie, the Creature (Cole Sprouse) goes from grotesque to hot as he and Lisa become increasingly intertwined.

The two first become friends, and Lisa helps the creature replace his ruined hand by killing Doug, a boy who attempted to take advantage of Lisa while she was drugged at a party. Later, when Lisa finds her crush, Michael, in bed with her stepsister sister, Taffy (Liza Soberano), she cuts of Michael's penis and attaches it to the Creature for some problematic rebound sex.

Though billed as a "horror/comedy", there's nothing particularly scary about the film. There are a few murders, but it's honestly pretty milquetoast and, by the time they happen, pretty expected and low key (as far as movie murders go). Indeed, the film doesn't really much bite at all, and while there are some interesting ideas and character development, it's honestly a bit boring. The main character is more moody than tragic, and none of the characters (aside from the stepsister maybe) are sympathetic. Lisa ends up being self-centered and callous and the Creature is just entirely passive. It's really just a story about two very uninteresting teenagers, one of whom just happens to be a zombie.
