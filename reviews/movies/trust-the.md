# The Trust

The Trust is An initially intriguing heist movie that ultimately goes nowhere. It's actually confusing; like, you might think you're missing something, but really, there's just nothing there.

Nicholas Cage—essentially playing himself, as always—and Elijah Wood are both quite good. The directing is fine. The dialog is well done. Really, everything about the movie is pretty good except it doesn't seem to have any point.

So, it's kind of hard to talk about the movie without spoilers since my issues with the movie are like is just stuff that happens in the movie so...

<details className="major-spoiler">
  <summary>What do I mean there's no point?</summary>

OK, first off, the corrupt cops don't seem all that corrupt. It's like a crime of opportunity and Lieutenant Stone—played by Cage—does kill a guy from spitting on him, but it's totally out of left field. There's some insinuation by Sergeant Waters—played by Wood—that Stone knows more than he's letting on, but Stone denies this and really, there's no reason to believe one way or the other and any sort of resolution goes out the window when Waters snaps at the end and ends up killing Stone.

The whole "what's up with secret, hi-tech vault" thing seems kinda cool, but comes to nothing. It's filled with diamonds and the low level drug dealer that ended up tipping them off to the vault is never explained and doesn't really make sense since it's clearly not a cash drop (as it's filled with diamonds) and it's totally unmanned. Certainly, the low level dealer doesn't have access to the vault so the workings of the whole operation don't make any sense.

And like, I get that Waters kinda freaks out, but he owes a lot of money and it's clearly established he has no ties so it would seem pretty easy to escape (until they both reveal themselves to their hostage for, again, inexplicable reasons). Even then, they really just need to use some of the vast wealth they just stole to fly away. And Waters whole thing about "they're going to kill us" seems to apply just as much if they return the loot as not since they've obviously broken into the safe and know everything. In fact, it seems far safer at that point to escape with the wealth than not. But whatever.

Which is all too bad, because The Trust is well made in every respect except it doesn't make any sense. It could have been an above average modern noir thriller, but ends up just being a flat nothing burger.
