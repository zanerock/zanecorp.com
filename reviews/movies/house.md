Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami) is distraught when her father remarries, and seeking escape, writes to her aunt asking if she can come visit. Gorgeous, along with her six friends are invited to visit the aunt, who lives in a large house in a small village. One by one, the girls are attacked and murdered by the sinister forces haunting the house. <span class="minor-spoiler">It's quickly revealed that the aunt is mystically connected to the house, and uses the spirit of youth to rejuvenate her aging body.</span>

The film does not take itself too seriously, and invites us to poke fun at it, while holding together enough of a narrative and conceptual integrity to remain a cohesive, horror film. Overall, it's quirky and fun.

Very riffable. The characters are largely and intentionally one-dimensional, witch each of the girls embodying—and named for—some character defining trait. There's the pretty one (Gorgeous), the smart one (Prof), the athletic one (Kung-Fu), etc. Being the 70's, there's of course the film is problematic when it comes to body shaming and also features "the fat one", Mac (Mieko Sato), who is just barely a bit meatier than the other girls and used for cringy comedic bits.

The most impressive thing about the movie is probably the absolutely gorgeous backdrops. Clealry filmed on a sound stage, the external shots all involve luscious backgrounds that I can only imagine were hand painted. Though clearly backdrops, the tone they set really works with the movie and the time period and sets a certain mood.
