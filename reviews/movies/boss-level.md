Roy Pulver (Frank Grillo) finds himself repeating the same day over and over again. A day where everyone is trying to murder him. What follows is an above average action movie with some really excellent action sequences with a dash of humor and a surprising amount of heart.

As an aside, I like the idea of "explainable brilliance". I.e., in action movies where the main character is incomprehensibly perfect in their fighting prowess, this movie kinda provides an explanation for that in that the main character just keeps repeating things until he gets it just right. All in all, it's an above average action movie.

While this is first and foremost an action movie, the interlude where Roy also uses his situation to get to know his previously neglected son and eventually create the perfect day is sweet. There's actually a surprising amount of character development for a movie that's 50% explosions and fight scenes.

Eventually, Roy learns that he has more to live for than he thought and he begins trying to solve the mystery of his situation in earnest. Being an action movie, it's all pretty neat and tidy in the end. If you're looking for a hardcore action movie with some feel good vibes thrown in, this is the movie for you.
