Sidelined after enduring unspeakable torture and suffering from PTSD, CIA agent Evan Lake goes rouge in order to avenge himself. And with Nicolas Cage playing said agent, you'd think it's a can't miss recipe for an action thriller. And you'd be wrong!

The story just never comes together. Evan's frontotemporal dementia is supposed to... make us sympathetic? add poignancy? But it just ends up being distracting. His big speech at the beginning of the movie about how the CIA is all about (get this) "values" is really try hard. It's really slow, with maybe a good 25% of the movie spent on the whole dementia thing. Like, they really hammer it.

  <summary>But don't worry, you shouldn't watch this movie.</summary>

Why do they hammer on the dementia so much? Well, it's to explain why, just when Evan has Banir right where he wants him, he suffers an episode and just wanders off. Like... okay. They spend a quarter of the movie setting up an anti-climax. Then, of course, Banir sends his remaining men to kill Evan and his sidekick at the resort they're staying at and a big gun battle ensues. Evan, armed with a pistol, takes out all the bad guys, armed with sub-machine guns and then drives to Banir's place to finally kill him. It's a real roundabout way of getting there.

Oh, then on the way back from killing Banir, Evan suffers another episode and veers into oncoming traffic (and presumably killing the innocent driver). Then they have some shots of Arlington cemetery and replay Evan's bullshit "the CIA is all about values" speech. Which has nothing to do with anything. All Evans actions are motivated by revenge and values don't play a part in anything... so it's just this weird tacked on thing.

Like, I don't know if it's Nic Cage's worst movie, but it's in the running.
