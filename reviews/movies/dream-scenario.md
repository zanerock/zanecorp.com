# Dream Scenario

<DocTags basePath="reviews" tags={ frontMatter.tags } />
<Ratings ratings={ frontMatter.ratings } />

In this A24 fantasy-drama, an awkward, sub-par professor at a rando university suddenly starts showing up in people's dreams all around the world. At first, he just stands around in the dreams because that what he's like in real life. <span class="minor-spoiler">Later, after an embarrassing experience with a fan, he becomes angry and his actions in the dreams turn violent just as the world turns against him.</span> It becomes apparent that his dream presence tracks the state of his psyche, which is ultimately quite simplistic and predictable.

The movie is not without impact and I think a lot of people can relate to the awkward, powerlessness that typifies the main character. We've all felt out of place and like we just keep saying the wrong thing at one time or another (or maybe I'm projecting). But, he's also extremely self-centered, so the audience's sympathy only goes so far. Nicolas Cage does a good job, and this in one of the rare movies where Cage—as Paul Mathews—isn't playing himself, but the main character is ultimately unsympathetic.

Which honestly leaves the movie as just kind of boring. The entire final third-to-quarter of the movie just didn't need to happen at all, and like the Jungle, just veers off into this anti-capitalist/anti-consumerism commentary that feels really out of place and just doesn't really fit with anything. Like, they're going for some dystopian future thing, but it doesn't have time to develop and just feels tacked on. Because they keep referring to "Paul Mathews" (the main character), it is a little funny because I just kept thinking the entire last part of the movie is an esoteric diss on the Paul Mathews Band.

I get that it's not supposed to be a feel good movie, but since it ultimately fails anyway, I think it would have played much better if Paul had a redemption arc. It could have been a lesson on the impact we have on other people and Paul could have meditated and found the motivation to become a better person. It's not really what A24 does, but it would have made a better movie.
