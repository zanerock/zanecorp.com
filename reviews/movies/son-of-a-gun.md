A gritty, stylish action crime drama starring Ewan McGregor as Brendan and Brenton Thwaites as his apprentice, JR. The movie is amazingly consistent all the way through; there's always something happening at a kinda medium pace. Though it never seems to be moving all that fast, you look back and realize a lot has happened in a mere 1 hr and 48 min.

Though there are a couple plot points (how did the guy in Melbourne know exactly when the hand off was going to be?), they're barely noticeable as Brendon navigates smoothly from one problem to the next. In some ways, it's like a bunch of little vignettes, seamlessly joined together. <span class="moderate-spoiler">Now a prison break. Now a heist. Now a double cross. Now revenge. Etc.</span> The movie does a good job of sprinkling in little details side shows without ever getting bogged down in anything. It's actually a pretty interesting narrative structure.

Given the quality of the movie and the star power of Ewen McGregor, the movie has a surprisingly low box office of $660K. Though not a masterpiece by any means, it's a perfectly fine, slightly above average crime movie IMO.

While there aren't really any "wow" moments, there's not a lot to criticize. As mentioned above, there is one point where Brendan needs to know when some other criminals are going to be meeting, and he just happens to know this guy that just happens to know the exact time and location for no apparent reason. Also, during the actual heist, Brendan makes a big deal about not shooting anyone, but seems to have no problem mowing down cops because... why? It's not like he has any special animosity for the law; I guess it's an "us vs them" and leave the civilians out of it sort of thing. <span class="major-spoiler">Perhaps the biggest flaw is it's not clear how Brendan gets captured in the end. At first, it seems like JR might have dropped a dime, but then... maybe not? It's really not clear. And also, how did all the civilians know to clear out without the paranoid Brendan noticing anything?</span> The movie loses a half point in quality overall, though none of the flaws are particularly glaring at the time.

Overall, a solid, understated and underrated film.
