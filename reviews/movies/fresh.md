This movie is disturbing. Especially (I would think and based on conversations), to the ladies. And that's both fulcrum that drives the movie and the point. It's pretty clearly a satire of male/female social and power dynamics. And overall, it's pretty successful.

The story focuses on Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) who we watch become increasingly disillusioned with dating apps and men. After a series of bad dates, she meets a guy in the grocery store. While ignoring a ton of red flags and making questionable choices, which are all pointed out by her best friend Mollie (Jonica T. Gibbs), she agrees to go on a trip with her new beau, Steve (Sebastian Stan). I don't think I'm really giving anything away when I tell you the trip—of course—turns out to be a ruse, and instead Noa finds herself shackled to a wall in Steve's house.

After that, the movie does take a few unexpected turns, and as horror/thrillers goes, it's relatively original with some real social commentary built in. It's not an "entertaining" movie, so it doesn't get high marks there, but that's not the point. It's meant to make you feel uncomfortable. The highly implausible situation reduces the fear/tension factor a bit (and that may be, in part, because I'm male), but again, that's fine because the movie does stay true to it's conceit and that's an important part of the film's commentary and narrative. When Noa is forced to play along with Steve for advantage, that feels all too real and relatable (even as a man) and because of that, is one of the more disturbing parts of the movie.

The only real problem with the movie is it really feels like it's either trying to set up some larger cinematic universe or there were additional themes and plot lines that ended up being cut from the final edit. There are multiple allusions to and a few quick shots of a shady cabal that ends up going nowhere. It would have been more creepy to just mention them offhandedly and not really get into at all. Instead, they go out of their way to establish iconography... it just feel a out of place.

There's also some very intriguing reveals regarding Steve's wife that hint at an interesting backstory which is just never explained. It really wouldn't have taken any extra time to flesh out her story and character a bit. Indeed, I thought she was going to represent another female archetype, <span class="moderate-spoiler">the Stock Holm syndrome wife</span>, but in the end, her story just goes nowhere.

There are a number of other minor errors. <span class="moderate-spoiler">The butler character is just unnecessary and ends up introducing un-needed complications and loose ends at the film's climax. The Brandi character that ends up going nowhere (I thought she was the wife for awhile, which would have been interesting and solved two problems in one go). The main thing, though, is the allusion to the outside forces that end up players that end up playing no role in the movie. Like, maybe they're meant to be a stand-in for society at large, or the power players thereof, but it's not developed enough to be meaningful, while also present enough to be distracting.</span>

Overall, though, a very solid darkly feminist tale.
