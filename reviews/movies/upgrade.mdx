  <summary>The first two paragraphs discuss some pretty standard and more or less predictable early plot points.</summary>

Of course it's a little dark and it starts off with a senseless killing. We have to establish motivation, right?[^1] Wife is killed in what's clearly a hit and our white male lead's neck is broken specifically to paralyze because... sadism? Or is there something more going on?

Our hero spends a little time mired down by his situation. Just then, a man with a solution appears: an AI[^2] powered chip that not only gives him the ability to move his limbs again, but also to get his revenge.

[^1]: <span class="minor-spoiler">I think it would have been more entertaining if the murder had happened off screen, and I think that would have been a better choice for this movie.</span>
[^2]: I'm not sure they ever actually say AI, but that's clearly part of what's going on. Maybe it's like that thing they do in zombie flicks where it's supposed to be just like our world, except they make up som new word and don't call the zombies zombies. It's weird.

With relative alacrity, our hero is united with his psychotic AI buddy. With the AI's big brain handily turning out clues that everyone else missed the duo embark on a mission of revenge. There's actually a lot of understated, dark humor in parts. It's understated, but there's enough for me to add this to the 'dark comedy' category.

It's mostly a romp of an action movie with moments of graphic violence sprinkled in. There are some twists and reversals to keep things entertaining, all leading up to a decent final reveal.

I really enjoyed the pacing. Once the AI is in place, the movie has one gear: go; though it's not frenetic like Crank or Hardcore Harry. The banter with the AI and light physical comedy of a man horrified by what his body is doing even as his body moves with utter precision is well done. The physical skill of Logan Marshal Green to convincingly operate his body and face in two different modalities is actually a little impressive once you notice it.

Before closing, I do have to say, I get what they're going for with the "sad quadriplegic" stuff. However, it ends up being a quite negative portrayal of quadriplegics. He's depicted as helpless and hopeless; with the character saying lines like my paraphrase: "How can I help? I can't even stand!" And I think if instead he'd been doing research, gathering clues on his own, etc. it would have been more interesting and worked just as well. Then when the AI comes along, it could still tie things together. There's no need to make the guy helpless in the intervening period. He could still be blocked and you can do all the anger and frustration that he's not making _more_ progress. I think it could have worked as well if not better.

Still, I don't think there's any question of an intentional slight in that regard, and I think we can still say this makes me very interested to check out some of the writer/director Steve Whannell's other works.

Despite the mostly forgivable flaws, this is overall a pretty fun movie that's got nearly optimal level of ridiculous and clever for an action movie. I mean, you gotta be ridiculous to have great fight scenes at the very least. And you need a lot of cleverness to distract from just how ridiculous the movie is. Which also means this movie is very riffable.
