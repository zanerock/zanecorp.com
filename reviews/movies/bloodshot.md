A completely generic action movie whose every plot point is less believable than the last, Bloodshot could be entertaining if it just ran with it, but it takes itself way too seriously. It's not just content with being an action movie, it wants to have mystery and drama, but it's just not up for the job.

The setup seems promising enough. A wounded soldier is rebuilt RoboCop style (except with nano-bots) and wakes up to find he's part of an elite cybernetic special forces unit of sorts. But right off, this is where things go a little sideways. Bloodshot (seriously, that is the character's film credit) truly superhero class. The nanobots in his bloodstream give him super strength, endurance, and instant healing powers. Like, he can survive being completely disintegrated into a mist. His teammates on the other are more standard cybernetic with body parts replaced. There's one guy with robotic legs that can run really fast, a former sniper with optics all over his body so he... see really well, and a lady who can breath underwater. I mean, cool powers, sure, but no where near the same league. And also a completely different mechanism. But whatever. Oh, and the doctor that runs all this has a cybernetic arm he uses to dent a desk at one point, but other than that it doesn't really come into it much.

At first, it seems like everything is oddly resolved in the first 20 minutes of the film; Bloodshot does some soldiering, hangs out with his wife, they're kidnapped, she's killed, he wakes up with superpowers and takes revenge. It doesn't seem like there's much left, but that's only because (and I don't think I'm giving much away here), there's a twist!

For myself, I like for movies to try and have some consistency. Like, they don't have to be realistic. X-Men doesn't make any sense. Superman is ridiculous. But whatever, I can accept a premise and movie on. The problem here is that it's just so unnecessarily baroque. Rising Spirit Technologies (RST), that resurrects Bloodshot, has mastered cybernetics, nanobots that make you invulnerable, perfect human-computer neural interface, the ability to project thoughts and vision perfectly into the mind, and flawless virtual reality. All this stuff is simultaneously front and center but also completely dismissed. The entire scheme to trick Bloodshot into working for RSI is just so complicated... while the other mercenaries are bought in. (Again, it's inconsistent.) Why not just give someone's that down to clown the powers? Why not just sell this stuff to billionaires and contract with governments? The entire plot is built around RST attempting to kill off former employees... but it's not really made clear why.

The movie asks you to keep on accepting poorly explained, poorly supported plot point after plot point. Most of the action sequences are kind of boring because Bloodshot is literally invulnerable and just stomps forward, taking bullets, and then punching through people's chest. There is an extended chase scene and battle between Bloodshot, Legs, and Mr. Optics, and that's pretty good. But you can just fast forward to that and forget about the rest of the rest of it.

Oh, also there's a really unnecessary and also silly dick shaming that's been captured in GIFs all over the Internet: "Six inches is not a lot." Like, OK size queen. WTF?
