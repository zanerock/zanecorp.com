This is a perfectly decent action movie. The plot is a bit silly. Following the pattern of the original TV show, the team is wrongfully convicted <span class="minor-spoiler">after being setup</span>, escapes prison to prove their innocence, moves heaven and earth to retrieve over $1 billion and US Treasury plates, no one cares cares because the army are jerks. (Everything is clearly set up for a sequel, but, though profitable, the movie underperformed and the plans were scrapped.)

I'm a bit surprised by the low Rotten Tomato (49%) and Metacritic (47%) scores. People seem to be complaining that it's an action movie. There's zero character development, but that's as it should be since the characters just are who they are. The plot is a little silly, but that's almost a requirement for action movies.

There are some pretty good action scenes. The cast is solid. The direction, cinematography, are good. It's appropriately silly. The A-Team delivers what it promises.

As an aside, the I watched a bit of the original show after this and I got say, the Captain Murdock character is _lot_ better in the movie. In the show, Murdock just spouts unrelated nonsense constantly. It's not funny in the least and just a really try-hard impression of "crazy" that no one ever actually does. In the movie, he's crazy reckless and a bit funny. To be honest, all the characters are a improved in the movie, and Murdock the most.
