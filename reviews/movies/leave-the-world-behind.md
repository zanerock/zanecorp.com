This is a pretty tight, well crafted post-apocalypse movies that tells the story from the point of view of a regular family with no particular information or skills. On a whim, Amanda Sandford (Julia Roberts) rents in rural New York state to get out of the city and get away from it all. Things get a little weird when an oil tanker runs aground on the beach the family is visiting (that's in the previews) and then tensions are further heightened when the owners of the Airbnb, G.H. Scott (Mahershala Ali; my favorite character) and his daughter Ruth (Myha'la) show and want to stay over night "because there's a blackout in the city".

As things develop further, it becomes apparent that things are worse than they may have thought. The two families must navigate their accidental relationship and figure out how much to trust each other as the world falls apart around them. It's an excellent twist on the classic apocalypse movie that looks at things from the point of view of the "average joe" who, knowing nothing and with no special skills, is suddenly thrust into a new and unfamiliar world. <span class="moderate-spoiler">The trust and friendship that develops between the two families is actually quite sweet.</span>

On the technical side, there's actually lots of interesting camerawork. There's one technical trick they really lean into, with long continuous shots that smoothly pass through solid objects. Like, with computers and everything it's not especially impressive, but they do a good job and use it to good effect. They also twist shot, so we're looking at things upside down, and other small things that lend and air of unease and a tinge of the surreal. It's well directed and the actors all give a solid, better than average performance. It's a movie you can really immerse yourself in.

<span class="minor-spoiler">I also like the scene with all the busted up Teslas used as weapons of war. Whether or not it's intentional, I really appreciate the recognition that Teslas are actually pretty slipshod and very likely vulnerable to just that kind of attack. Elon Musk is a very successful quasi-con man.</span>
