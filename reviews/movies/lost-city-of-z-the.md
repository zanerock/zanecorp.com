It's the story of a early 20th century British major turned explorer who develops a passion for finding an imagined lost city he refers to as Z (zed, since it's British). The story is most interesting for it's peak into the life of a early 20th century British officer, his conceptions of manhood, and the stresses put on the family. It's well made, with good acting and dialog.

One of the big themes of the film is the lead character's—Percy Fawcett played by Charlie Hunnam—belief that there are undiscovered ancient cities in the Amazon and that finding proof of an advanced, ancient, non-white civilization would revolutionize history and challenge the deeply embedded racism in British society. And despite some misogyny and a bit of casual racism, it's overall a picture of a rare progressive who was willing to put their life on the line to advance the cause of equality and racial understanding.

Unfortunately, that part of the story is all bullshit. A little googling turns up some info—like this [Forgbe's article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidanderson/2019/04/30/the-lore-of-lost-cities-imagining-the-lost-city-of-z/)—that confirms many of the basic points in the movie, but also points out that Fawcett believed Z could only have been created by "white indians" who were a "superior race". When an actual native tells Fawcett that his his ancestors built cities, Fawcett records in his diary: “this I am inclined to doubt, for he, like the Mehinaku Indians, is of the brown or Polynesian type, and it is the fair or red type I associate with the cities.”

Fawcett saw Z not as proof of the basic equality of all peoples, but a lost outpost of explicitly white refugees from Atlantis. Evidence for this Atlantian civilization was the actual historical revolution the real Percy Fawcett was after and the entire project was about cementing, rather than challenging white authority.

This literal whitewashing of history actually makes the whole movie pretty gross. It creates a false hero and, by focusing on fictitious progressive, serves to downplay the actual racism of the time. While Percy Fawcett was no great man, he did lead a very interesting life and a movie about that life seems reasonable. This movie, however, is not. I can't think it's anything other than a conscious project that knowingly lies in order to purposely downplay racism, both then and now.
