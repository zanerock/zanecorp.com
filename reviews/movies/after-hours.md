Paul Hackett leads a boring, unfulfilling life doing data entry for an anonymous, soulless company. After yet another day, indistinguishable from each that's come before, Paul meets Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) in a diner when she notices he's reading one of her favorite books, Tropic of Cancer. (This is probably the least believable part of the movie; then again, the didn't have Netflix back in the 80's.) Paul gets Marcy's number and later that night, calls her up.

Under the pretense of buying a paper weight (I mean... come on, it's creepier than just saying you just want to hang out), Paul wrangles an invite and takes a cab to Marcy's place. Things start to go wrong for Paul right away when his money flies out the cab window and he has to duck the bill.

Paul makes his way to Marcy's like 5,000 loft apartment that she shares with Kiki (Linda Fiorentino). Kiki's working on some papier-mâché art that totally could pay for her apartment and her and Paul chat for a bit. Paul then heads back to Marcy's room where he problematically rifles through her stuff and finds evidence Marcy might have some burns somewhere. Having previously established that Paul was inexplicably warehoused in a burn ward when he was a kid and totally traumatized, Paul gets ooked out. Plus, Marcy's acting a bit erratic, so Paul decides to jet.

But of course, not having any money, Paul has no good way to get back home. He tries jumping the turn style right in front a cop, which of course doesn't work out. Paul sort of passively bumps along, low key creeping. All he wants to do is get home, but after racially stereotyping a couple Hispanic fellows and undressing a dead lady, he instead finds himself trapped in a maddening situation spiraling out of his control.

There's something to be said for Scorsese; he does make consistently high quality movies. The pacing and the tone are excellent. There's unease and tension punctuated by terror and broken up by moments of respite. There are no wasted scenes and though everything is objectively unlikely, it feels very real. Paul is not entirely sympathetic, but neither does he deserve the reality he finds himself in. Is he just cursed? Is he being punished for sticking his head up? Or does shit just happen?

  <summary>The bit at the end in the club...</summary>

So, when the mob was hunting him down and he hides out in the cellar of the club with the lady who makes the paper weights (people love it when you bring meaningless references back around), it was pretty clear she was going to entomb him in papier-mâché as soon as she suggested hiding him in the statue. Setting aside whether there was time to actually build up things as much as she did and my strong suspicion that it would be fairly easy to break out of such a statue, it was stylistically pretty interesting. Was the lady a papier-mâché based serial killer as the peek into the side room suggests? Who knows! It was fun.

I was expecting the movie to end there, and the truly comedic (in the classical sense) arrival of Cheech and Chong put an interesting and unexpected humorous twist on an otherwise rather stark film. Despite the complete unreality of Cheech and Chong easily lifting a grown man up a rope through a manhole, the return of Paul to his day job and completely milquetoast life just felt right IMO. Maybe the moral is that if you're a boring, passive, kinda creepy dude, don't try to involve yourself with interesting people; it's not going to turn out well for you.
