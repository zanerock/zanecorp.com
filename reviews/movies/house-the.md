This is a collaboration between numerous artists on three stories loosely connected by "the house", which consumes it's occupants in various ways. Though the three stories are quite different, I would say the movie is tonally and thematically cohesive.

The first story focuses on the failed scion of a rich family, spurned by his relatives and seeking ever elusive success, who is offered a Faustian bargain by a secretive, eccentric architect who builds a mansion for the family, but then just sort of hangs on and starts switching things up and things get weirder and weirder. The second story is about a contractor who's sunk his life savings into "the house", but things don't work out. The final story is about a small time landlord and the community living in "the house", which is the last little bit of land in an flooded wasteland.

Each of the stories all touch on some element of greed, perhaps, though it's not set up such that any of the characters really are "getting what they deserve" or anything. Indeed, everyone is more or less just trying to get by when they get caught up enmeshed with "the house".

The final story <span class="minor-spoiler">does end on a hopeful note</span>, and it does feel like there's a loose thematic arc between the second and third stories, with the same loose arc present in the first story. So, trying to connect everything up neatly is a little messy. The first story seems to deal with greed and losing sight of things, as well as perseverance (embodied in different characters). The second is maybe hopelessness and entrapment; an inability to let go. The final story is definitely about letting go and moving on. Maybe you could say they're all, in different ways, about the sunk cost fallacy. Haha.

The House is definitely a mood, and I did enjoy it. The animation was impressive, and the mood and tone each story set, along with the look of the animation and everything really came together visually quite nicely. It's weird, and quirky, and pretty slow moving for the most part. One of the more artsy movies I've seen in awhile.
