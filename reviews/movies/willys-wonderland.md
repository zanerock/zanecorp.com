It's the story of a creepy Chucky Cheese style pizzeria complete with creepy, murderous animatronic robots. The film is basically Five Night's at Freddy's[^1] in the style of Army of Darkness. Nic Cage, as the entirely silent "The Janitor", does a good job playing himself and the stylized tone isn't bad, though ultimately the movie is a bit too silly and way too predictable to be scary.

[^1]: While the Five Night's at Freddy's movie was released in 2023, two years after Willy's Wonderland, the game franchise has been around since 2014 and seems a very likely influence.

The story starts with Cage powering down some back country lane and chugging power drinks in a beautiful kitted out Camero when all of a sudden he's brought up short by a zig-zag (portable tire spikes) and has to call a tow truck. This is presumably the only time he talks the whole movie. though the call itself is off screen.

In the meantime, we're introduced to Liv (played by Emily Tosta), who's intent on burning down Willy's. Her and Cage will have a somewhat inappropriate connection.

While not a big problem for the genre in general, the movie is riddled with a bit too many ridiculous plot points; the first of which is that the back woods micro-town mechanic have specialized 20" sports tires in stock. Lacking the cash to pay for repairs, he's offered a deal: stay overnight at the boarded up Willy's Wonderland and clean the place up and the Boss Hog style owner, Tex Macadoo (played by Ric Reitz) will foot the bill and Cage can be on his way.

Of course Cage accepts the ridiculous offer of $1,000 for one nights cleaning and a good 10% or so of the movie is spent on cleaning montages which are honestly not the worst thing about the movie. Cage is incredibly efficient.

<span color="red">What follows contains unredacted spoilers</span>, but like I said, the movie is predictable enough I don't think I'm giving too much away. Cage ends up fighting the possessed animatronic robots, easily beating each one, despite their previously having shown super-human strength and special powers which, for some reason, they never use on Cage.

Perhaps the biggest flaw in the movie is when it's revealed that the towns folk have made a deal with animatronic horrors. Like... why? Why not just burn the place down. The sheriff explains this away with "we would have lost too many battling those things", but why? Just burn it down. Sure. the creatures have killed, but that was by using stealth and while strong. they're clearly shown to be vulnerable to physical destruction. It would have made a lot more sense if they'd made the deal and gotten something out of it, like wealth or secret powers of the occult or something. They just give the robots way too much credit.

The movie has some fun bits, some interesting characters, but is ultimately a bit too caught up in it's own stylization and a bit too silly. The kids are a bit too dumb, the adults a bit too irrational, and the fights are way too easy.
