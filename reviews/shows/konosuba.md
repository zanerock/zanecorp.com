# KonoSuba : God's Blessing on this Wonderful World!

This review is on season 1; there is a second season but I don't currently have access to it.

KonoSuba is just fun. It's a comedy anime setup as a "power up" anime, except the main character ends up less interested in powering up and just tries to live a comfortable life.

The main character, Kazuma Satou, dies at the start and is sent to a fantasy world with MMORPG dynamics. Satou is offered one power or item for use in the fantasy world and partially out of spite, partially trying to be clever, Satou chooses the goddess Aqua herself, who is overseeing his transition to accompany him. Aqua turns out to be less than useful, and the two form a dysfunctional party with an archmage who can only cast one spell and masochistic crusader who can't fight except to tank. Together, they blunder through comical adventures.

(Of course) all Satou's companions are ladies, and ridiculous bosoms abound. The show is liberally infused with generally light and lighthearted sexual innuendo. The most direct of which is the masochistic crusader, Darkness. Darkness is essentially unable to attack as she can't ever hit her target, but she is quite skilled at, and enjoys tanking, often commenting with apparent glee how her enemies will rend her clothes, beat her, etc.
