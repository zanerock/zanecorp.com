Juzo Fujimaki goes on the run after killing the rapist who attacked the daughter of his martial arts master, but surfaces after killing a bear with his bear hands. This puts him on the radar of the authorities and organizers of an underground martial arts competition "to find the strongest fighter in the world".

With such barn burners as Baki Hanma and Kengan Ashura under their belt, Garouden is frankly disappointing. The animation is a bit stiff and flat, the plot is pretty standard, and the action underwhelming. There's lots of talk of inner conflict, but the whole thing lacks any real tension. In short, it's a bit boring. The main character is stiff and dry, and though he complains about "the beast within me" a bunch, the conflict and his supposed guilt just don't come across at all.

There's a "love interest" sub-plot that lacks any signs of love, and in which the lady has zero agency. There's a related sub-plot involving who will inherit the main character's Takemiya style that just leads to a few more boring fights. The most interesting sub-plot is the training sequence with the monk in the mountains, but it's a mildly entertaining interlude at best.

While there is some attention paid to the technicalities of martial arts and a couple decent action sequences, Garouden just never comes together. The characters are flat, the action is flat, and even the animation is flat. It's just flat.
