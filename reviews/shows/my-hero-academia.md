This review is on seasons 1-4.

A well made, fairly standard shonen anime with good pacing and some nice touches, this is the story of Izuku Midoriya, a powerless boy in a wold of superheros who comes to inherit the power of the greatest superhero of them all. The original manga is written and illustrated by Kōhei Horikoshi.

While this is a very conventional shonen focused primarily on the main characters "power up" arc, it's quite well done and if you enjoy shonen anime, then you'll enjoy My Hero Academia. The story focuses on Izuku Midoriya, who goes from a powerless nobody to the inheritor of one of the worlds great super powers: One for All. He attends school at UAW, the premier superhero academy and the alma mater of his long time favorite hero and now mentor, All Might. Together, the class matures while facing a steady stream of villains and trying to unravel the mystery behind their primary foe, the League of Villains.

Some things I liked about the show:
<div class="flow-list">
- All Might, in his powered up form, in drawn in a distinctly different (but compatible) style evocative of 1940/50s Golden Age comics.
- Something similar is done with the Mirio Togata character, an always positive, innocent (but not naive) character whose drawing style appears to be a reference to the happy-go-lucky Belgian comic book character, Tintin.
- The action scenes are fast paced and quite good.
- The dramatic mini-climaxes—where a character declares or enacts their resolution—are well paced, excellently scored, and occur in just the right frequency.
- The All Might retirement arc was one of my favorites with an excellent mini-climax.
- There are a good number side characters and we do get into their stories and characters a bit. It strikes a good balance between variety and keeping the main story line going.

My only criticism is that I would like to see more done with the villains. The motivations and drives of a couple characters are fleshed out a bit, but I'd like to see more balance in the backstories and more complex villains. The only one I can remember with a onscreen backstory is the main protagonist, Tomura Shigariki. It does a decent job of explaining "why he's messed up", but even there I wanted a little bit more.

The villains in general come off as "just evil". The ones that aren't just "plain psychotic" often espouse some philosophy, but for the most part they seem to be just doing "bad stuff because" and their philosophy doesn't really come into the story or seem to affect their actions much. The big exception is Chizome Akaguro, or Hero Killer. While he lacks a backstory, he does have a consistent philosophy that does come into the story at key points.

Still, with excellent pacing and production values, good writing, and above average action scenes, this is definitely one to add to any shonen fan's watch list.
