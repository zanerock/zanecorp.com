This review is on season 1.

Shogun is the story of Lord Toranaga and his quest to become Shogun (more or less military dictator) of Japan. Much of the action involves feudal Japanese politics (or at least a fictionalized version thereof) and it's fascinating. An English ship's pilot and his ship and dozen or so cannon are injected into tho situation by way of shipwreck. In the backdrop lurk the Portuguese and their monopoly on trade with Japan which the English pilot, John Blackthorne ably played by Cosmo Jarvis is intent on breaking. Many of the elements of the story are true to life, though Shogun is historically inspired rather than historically accurate in terms of plot

The 2024 mini-series a lot less white savior-y than the books and Blackthorne is more along for the ride and less of a driver than I remember of the book (which I read quite awhile ago). And the real powerhouse performance and key character is Toda Mariko played by Anna Sawai. Mariko is assigned to be Blackthorne's interpreter and minder and it's a great addition to the original story (in which, as far as I remember, Blackthorne teaches himself Japanese in a remarkable short period of time). Sawai's performance as Mariko is really a joy. Even the way she walks is just so perfect.

The show is very entertaining and exceptionally well made. Most of the dialogue is not only in Japanese, but (as I've read) in medieval Japanese. Which considering most viewers would never pick up on, is a really nice touch. Given all that, it would have been interesting if Blackthorne an Mariko spoke Portuguese to each other. It's clearly stated that this is what they're supposed to be doing, even though it's rendered in English. In fact, most of the English rendered dialogue "should" be in Portuguese, but oh well. I get that may have been a bridge too far and probably would have cost the production revenue.

Putting that aside. the costumes, set, acting, direction, writing, is all top notch. It's certainly beautiful and at least feels quite faithful to the time and place. It does an excellent job of making you feel like you have a real window into another time and culture. I've tried to do some digging into how much of the elements and tropes are accurate, but I mostly get commentary of historical events

A lot of the story turns on the power players (Toranaga and the council of regents) political machinations, which turn on notions of propriety and "being civilized" that, I think, gets a little lost sometimes. It would be nice to get a little more explanation of the motivations sometimes, perhaps by way of a hothead retainer who needs things explained to him, though for the most part the underlying factors do come through rather well. It would also be nice to see more of the standard village life. You gut little glimpses, but the show does such a good job with those, I want it to do more. Blackthorne on a shopping trip, Blackthorne leaning about local boat building or fishing techniques. Something like that.

All in all, the show is beautifully rendered and though very entertaining IMO, even more interesting for the backdrop of sets, costumes, tropes, etc. It's exceptionally well made and stays consistent throughout.
