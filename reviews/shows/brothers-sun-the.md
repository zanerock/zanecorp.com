# The Brothers Sun

<DocTags basePath="reviews" tags={ frontMatter.tags } />

The Brothers Sun isn't bad, but it isn't great either. My main issue with the series is that it's a bit muddled. There's just no real focus. It splits it's time between the two brothers, Charles and Bruce Sun with secondary attention paid to the Mother, Mama Sun. Charles is the "action" guy, Bruce is supposed to be the "funny" guy, and Mama Sun is the "smart" one who brings a bit of palace intrigue to the story.

The action is quite good, but not sufficient to carry the show. It's billed as an "action/drama/comedy", though I didn't really find it funny. In part because the supposedly comedic Bruce character is not very funny and his main attribute is just weakness. This is no fault of Sam Li, who portrays Bruce; his character is just wishy-washy. In theory he's supposed to be the most relatable, but he's just kinda pulled along for the most part until the very end (which _is_ kinda clever). The character really needs to be more of something; more bumbling, more clever, more substantial, more _something_.

Mama Sun is potentially the most interesting character as she's involved in behind-the-scenes maneuvering to take control of the Jade Dragons triad after the father, Big Sun, is put out of commission by a rival gang. The problem here is her plot is secondary to the brothers and what we do get is a lot of "tell" and very little "show". At various points it revealed that she's pulled off some maneuver, but we don't really see it. It's also unfortunate that Michelle Yeoh, who plays Mama Sun, only gets one kinda half-ass action sequence. This is the lady from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Police Story 2, Tai Chi Master, etc. after all.

  <summary>About the Boxers...</summary>

So, the boxers are this righteous counter-gang who fight against the evil triads, right? Like, they're violent and they threaten Bruce, but from everything we see, they are essentially the good guys in all this. It's just weird to have this other, highly sympathetic semi-protagonist (again, unfocused) thrown into the mix at the very end, only to have them all brutally killed. It would have made sense if Charles and Mama were set up as anti-heroes, but it's written like we're supposed to overlook the fact that the Suns are bad people... except then we're reminded that they have innocent blood on their hands? It just doesn't make any sense. A non-triad rival gang would have made a lot more sense.

In summary, it would have been better to just drop the comedic elements or go with a more dry humor. There's some interesting bits, but it's too unfocused. It would have been better to focus more on Mama's political maneuvering or how Charles is trapped in a life he really doesn't want. The Bruce character should have been a secondary spectator or completely reworked.
