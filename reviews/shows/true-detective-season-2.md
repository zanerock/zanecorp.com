Overall, True Detective Season 2 is a hot mess. There are entertaining elements. The acting is good. The cinematography and dialog are good. It's overall high quality. But there's ultimately a lack of focus on multiple levels. There's nothing to focus on or really get behind.

First off, there are four viewpoint characters—three cops and a mobster—and our point of view is constantly shifting between them. This in itself isn't a problem; the acting is excellent and the characters individually compelling. TD2 is first and foremost a character drama.

The main problem with that is there isn't a unifying story behind everything. Each character main goals and drive never really overlap or interact. Velcoro (Collin Farrel) wants his son back, no one else is involved. Paul Woodrugh (Taylor Kitsch) has PTSD, but that's never really explored, and only wants to return to the open road as a motorcycle cop, which no one else cares about. Frank Semyon (Vince Vaughn) wants to restore his lost wealth, which no one else cares about. Ani Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams) just wants to do her job and is the only one that's really concerned primarily with solving the crime. Usually in multi POV narratives there's a single goal (like Game of Thrones where everyone is vying for control) or conclusion which draws everyone together. Here, the motivations are completely disconnected and there are essentially four entirely independent endings. There are four entirely separate stories that happen to superficially overlap.

It's unfocused. Everyone is kinda sympathetic and there is no real bad guy. Which, in a way I like because in reality, the "bad guy" is usually systemic forces, which is kind of the idea here. However, in this case they don't really focus on that and the injection of Vince Vaughn's character—Frank Semyon—as the relatable and sympathetic face of the crime really muddles what otherwise could have been an interesting take on systemic injustice and the disproportionate power of the wealthy.

Which brings us to the second big problem: the "wrong" is really the systemic corruption of wealth and power, but that's not the focus. Instead, the actual crimes being investigated are secondary, which in itself is fine. They never really hit on the power and corruption angle. The actual wrongdoing would be obvious to anyone who simply followed the news, and the discovery and investigation center the action at the periphery of the real problem.

  <summary>Third, the show is unrelentingly grim, but fails to own it.</summary>

In the end, all the main characters are destroyed and, while some of the baddies die (live by the sword, die by the sword), there's no reason to believe that the larger wrong is corrected or even affected by anything that goes on. The bit at the end with Ani and Frank's wife, Jordan (Kelly Reilly) turning over their evidence to a reporter is just too little too late and honestly a bit chickenshit. Everything up to that point has been nothing but nihilism and failure and just saying, "there's going to be an expose in some newspaper somewhere" just makes me think, "so what?". Rather than the triumph it's supposed to be, it just ends up being sad.

Setting aside the major structural problems of the show, there was one scene that just _really_ annoyed me and really damaged my trust in the narrative. It's not even that important to the plot so I don't consider it a spoiler, but there's a scene where our three cop characters are gathered together to raid a warehouse. It all goes sideways and erupts in a massive gunfight in which literally _everyone_—dozens of cops—are killed in a hail of bullets and our three main characters are the _only_ survivors just because. Like, just leave a handful of beat cops alive and it's fine. It's just a ridiculous instance of unbelievable plot armor that didn't have to happen and really breaks any trust in the narrative for no reason whatsoever. While I think TD2 is ultimately pretty flawed, this was an instance of sheer stupidity.

In summary, TD2 is like four independently interesting character sketches built around an unimportant mystery that entirely misses the larger point. It seems like a commentary on the pointlessness of life and pervasive corruption, except in the end, it fails to own that and ends up really having no point at all.
