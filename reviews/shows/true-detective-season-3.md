With season 3, True Detective is back with a winning formula. A pair of detectives. A tale told through memories. A story set in the South.

With one child dead and another missing, this is the life defining case for for Wayne Hays (Mahershala Ali) and Roland West (Stehpen Dorff). The story unfolds across three different decades with the action set in 1980, 1990, and 2015. The 2015 Hays is an old man facing his biggest regret and returning to the case that destroyed his career and defined his life. As Hays recalls the key points in the case, we are transported back to the 80's, when two children—Will and Julie Purcell—first went missing, and 90's, when the cases was re-opened.

Season three is overall quite good. The characters are complex while remaining consistent and relatable. The story is tragic and in many ways much larger than the first season as the tragedy comes to define not only the children, but their parents, the detectives, and even the entire town. The story too—spanning 35 years—feels larger.

The persistent theme of corruption which pervades seasons 1-3 is present, but more subtle. <span class="minor-spoiler">The case is pinned on a patsy and prematurely closed in both the 80's and 90's.</span> Toxic masculinity is also present, but we also have Hays' wife—Amelia Reardon (Carmen Ejogo)—a female character with agency who is both independent and most objectively successful character in the whole series, both monetarily and in terms of achieving their personal goals. It's all still very male focused, but—despite season 2's Ani Bezzerides—this time there's a lady who really drives significant aspects of the plot forward.

One huge piece of the story is detective Hays' advancing dementia. The story stars with the elderly 2015 Hays getting out of bed and listening to tape recorded notes left by his son to orient him for the day. While heavily emphasized, Hays' dementia doesn't really end up of being much consequence. Ultimately, he's able to remember everything he needs to and there's really no point at which his dementia effects the story until the very end. <span class="major-spoiler">Indeed, my theory is the entire dementia angle was cooked up so that we could have the final scene where Hays', having gone to visit the now discovered Julie first forgets, but then briefly remembers why he's at her house before deciding to truly let go and let the past be forgotten. It's a poignant scene, but complicated by the fact that the price being that Julie is also left thinking her father didn't love her and had given her up, as well as leaving the father falsely convicted of murder and child abuse.</span> Beyond that, though, the dementia feels contrived and, while interesting, is more of a distraction than anything else. Hays dementia presents in a very unorthodox manner that never really inconveniences him or the story and, all in all never really addresses the real issues or challenges of the condition.

One of the big strong suites of the story, on the other hand, is the relationship between Hays and his girlfriend and later wife Amelia. Amelia has the strongest personality of all the characters in the story. She knows what she wants, and she goes for it. The fact that she becomes a successful writer off the back of the Purcell case, which ends up ruining Hays' career for having shared details of the case, provides the basis for the richest and most interesting interpersonal dynamic of the entire series.

Ultimately, however, the story is marred by the unnecessarily baroque and highly improbable resolution to the case. <span class="major-spoiler">Julie was kidnapped and held prisoner to satisfy the desires of an insane heiress, only to escape to a covenant where she's reunited with her childhood friend and one true love. So, the nuns conspire to fake her death to set her free. I mean, come on. Especially since the faked death seems unnecessary. Everyone that would have cared was already dead, and it's not really clear that anyone was actually after her in the first place.</span>

Overall, though, it's a strong piece of compelling drama. Though it's arguably the most tragic of the (currently) 4 seasons, like the first, it ends on an upbeat note. While I think the dementia angle is a little distracting, it's more of a wasted opportunity than a glaring flaw and overall the story is tight and moves with purpose.
