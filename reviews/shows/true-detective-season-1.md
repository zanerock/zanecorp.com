When a girl is found ritually murdered and posed outside a small Louisiana town, two troubled detectives are caught up in a spiraling web of depravity and corruption that slowly unwinds over the course of eight episodes. However, if you're looking for a pure mystery thriller, you might be a little disappointing in that True Detective spends a lot (perhaps the bulk) of time on the two main characters personal lives and drama as the it does on the case itself. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; the characters are consistent throughout and as a drama, it's also pretty good. I'm just saying that while many crime-drama-mysteries make use of a "troubled investigator" trope, True Detective really focuses on this aspect of the story.

True Detective is quite well made. Detective Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) both do an excellent job, though (maybe because his character is more interesting), it's really McConaughey that runs away with the show. Without getting into how accurate it might or might not be, the show does a great job of evoking a feel for late 90s, early 2000s backwoods Louisiana. Writer/creator Nic Pizzolatto deserves recognition, as does director Cary Joji Fukunaga.

True Detective does a good job earning it's grit. And the motivations of the characters, especially Rust Chole, are both clear and compelling. It's an excellent character drama combined with a decent mystery.

  <summary>Regarding Cohle's character development.</summary>

At the very end, when Marty and Rust are looking up at the sky and Rust says the oldest story is "light vs dark". Then Marty looks up at the night sky and says: “Well, I know we ain’t in Alaska, but it appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory.” Rust says Marty has it wrong and explains, “Well, once there was only dark. You ask me, the light’s winning.”

This is almost exactly a scene from Alan Moore's Top 10 when (as I remember) a Knight Chessman and the Porter are dying together. The Chessman talks about how he fights for the light against the dark, the Porter looks up and says, "Looks like the dark is winning". To which the Chessman replies, "No, there used to be only dark."
