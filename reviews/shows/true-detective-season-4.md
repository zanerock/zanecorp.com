Set in the fictional town of Ennis Alaska, the story begins as the sun sets for the long night, casting the entire story in the dark cold. I really loved the setting and tone for this season of True Detective. The mystery is creepy, and the backdrop is saturated with ghosts and dark specters.

Season 4 sticks with the winning formula of focusing on two cops wrestling with their inner demons. It does away with the non-linear narrative structures of seasons 1 and 3, and instead focuses on tone and backdrop. It also steps away from the persistent theme of toxic masculinity and male trauma and instead features the communal and historical trauma of a town colonized and exploited.

Two female leads is another welcome change and Jodi Foster as Chief Liz Danvers and Kali Reis as trooper Evangeline Navarro both turn in excellent performances. Indeed, the cast overall is, as with every season, top quality and the tone, atmosphere and cinematography are, IMO, the best out of the first four seasons.

Despite all that, season 4 still didn't work as well as the 1st season for me. One problem I had was the Danvers and Navarro characters are essentially alone. Indeed, loneliness and isolation are background themes in the show. Flashes of community and bonds among the native population that provide a contrast to the isolation of the other characters. In seasons 1 and 3, by contrast, there was a rich dynamic between the two main characters that was really enjoyable aspect of the show, and that was just totally absent in season 4.

Also, I have to say, though using children is often a cheap device, it kinda works. The fact that the crime here involved a bunch of middle aged, mostly white men made me a bit less sympathetic and since the entire research facility was a little shady anyway and you're led to suspect from the very beginning that the murders were justified to some level, I just wasn't nearly as invested in finding the killer.

<div class="major-spoiler">
  <summary>I really enjoyed the whole dynamic between father and son Hank and Peter Prior, but the resolution didn't work for me at all.</summary>

When Peter shoots Frank to protect Danvers, he was just way too unbothered. Clearly, Frank was set up as a bad guy, but he was also sympathetic and it wasn't clear that he was that terrible of a father. Sure, they were estranged, but there was no evidence that I recall for a seething hatred of his father or anything like that, but Peter didn't hesitate, or even seem all that disturbed after murdering his dad. Like, not only did he kill someone, but it was his father. I just didn't buy it and it would have been a lot more poignant if Peter had been more upset. And also, why take a headshot? You're taught to aim for the body in any case and the point should have been to stop Hank, why go immediately to a surefire killing intent?

<div class="major-spoiler">
  <summary>And when the full story is finally unveiled, like season 3, the impact of the reveal is dampened by unnecessary complications. The ending is too unbelievable and a really mixed bag.</summary>

Part of the problem with season 4 is the "big evil" that lurks in the background is capitalism and corporate greed, but all that seems entirely disconnected from the murders until the very end. If they'd at least implied some connection from the beginning, the viewer would have a lot more reason to care about the resolution and keep "the big evil" in mind. As it is, it just felt like a disconnected sideshow the entire time.

I really enjoyed the revelation that the indigenous cleaning ladies banded together to avenge their friend, but the whole thing with the scientists covering for the mining company because the pollution "made their jobs easier" was just a ridiculous concept. It was a cartoonish idea that, for me, really undermined the seriousness and tone of the entire show. And, like season 3, it was just unnecessary. If they'd just left it as "the scientists were covering because they wanted to keep the funding going", it would have been a lot stronger ending.

Finally, the closure of the mine was actually lost on me at first. There's one shot of a fence with a "Closed" sign, which is one among many and I guess it's vaguely hinted in Danvers' interview at the end, but they don't really hit it. And frankly, the idea that one leaked video, which can't be substantiated and was arguable made under duress by a lone scientist with every motive to hid his own culpability in the mis-reporting would have shut down the mine is ludicrous. There is no way the courts would have done anything and it's not like the video told the townspeople anything they didn't know. The mine was still the sole employer and, despite Danvers' blithe "the town was here before" bit at the end, it's not like the loss of the sole economic engine wouldn't collapse the population. So... IDK. There was a real need to turn up more evidence, maybe involve the CEO in some way and have them go to jail and have the corporation pay a bunch of fines and the EPA come in to oversee cleanup, but keep the mine open or have the larger company create a fund for a cleanup, and let the cleanup employ the townspeople. That would have been a much, much more stronger ending.
