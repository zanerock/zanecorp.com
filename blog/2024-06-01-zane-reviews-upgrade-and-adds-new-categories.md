# Zane Reviews Upgrade and Adds New Categories

Today, Zane reviews the problematic but still quite entertaining sci fi action flik: [Upgrade](/docs/movie-revies/upgrad). Inspired by this relatively high quality yet very riffable movie, I also added the 'riffable' category. Which separating "riffable" from "bad", made me think we also needed an 'earnest' category, as this is a feature of all great, bad movies.
