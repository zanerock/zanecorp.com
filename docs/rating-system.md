# Rating System

Movies and shows are rated in three dimensions: entertainment, impact, and quality. Entertainment is more or less how fun it is. Impact is how much it moved you; how did it stir your emotions. Quality is about production values, cinematography, the score, and the technical excellence (or lack thereof).

For entertainment and quality, two and a half stars (<span class="u2800">★★<span class="half-star">⯨</span></span>) more or less means average, with lower ratings being below average and higher ratings above. Impact, however, starts at zero and only goes up. There is no "negative" impact, so impact scores tend to be lower relative to entertainment and quality. I.e., you can think of entertainment and quality as rating from -5 to +5, whereas impact rates from 0 to +5.

A good action or horror movie tends to be entertaining, but low impact. Good dramas tend to be less entertaining, but higher on impact. Quality is genre independent.
