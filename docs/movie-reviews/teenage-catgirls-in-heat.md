This movie is about as bad as they come. And, like many bad movies, it's refreshingly earnest. You can tell the two main characters are really having fun with their parts. As they should, as this would be their only time playing lead roles.

Also, there are tits.

Now that we've gone over what's good about the movie, let's dig a bit deeper into all the ways it's such a bad movie.

So, the main conceit of the movie is that a sinister Egyptian cat god, housed in a statue, has been awakened. It commands all the cats in the area to kill themselves, sacrificing one of their nine lives in order to take human form. (Of course, the transformation happens off screen due to  budgetary constrains.) It's not a bad promise really. And if I didn't lay out this basic premise, you'd be hard pressed to guess WTF is going on for a good long while.

To be fair, maybe they did explain the basic operation earlier on, but another aspect of this movie is that the original not available anywhere to stream. It seems like it used to be available on the [Troma](https://troma.com) site, but no longer. You can't even buy it, except on [VHS](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Catgirls-Heat-VHS/dp/6305241996/).

What is available is an [intentionally shitty version on YouTube](https://youtu.be/JfsaYvPYVDE?si=RCW8LdhNNKIUaw8j). This copy boasts the following features:
<div class="flow-list">
- Cuts something like 15% off the top of the frame.
- It's severely down-rezzed. It's quite fuzzy.
- It looks like you're watching the movie behind a dirty window; there's a persistent brown fog on either side of the frame.
- All the audio has been moved up an octave or two. This was kind of funny.
- It's missing about 12 minutes of runtime. The movie starts and ends abruptly, and some amount of time has just been chopped off. I also suspect it's slightly sped up.
- The movie is mirrored. This one isn't so bad, just a little odd looking whenever you're looking at something with words on.

This is all of course to avoid algorithmic identification. The move's only had 8.3K views in 7 years (as of May 11th, 2025). So I guess it's working... yaaaayy....

Which is all to say, it's very possible there was a more cogent explanation of what was happening and I simply missed it because it can be hard to hear at times. I also had to step out for ~25 min to handle a family emergency... but really, missing 1/3 of the movie doubtfully changes much.

I really wish they'd been more clever about the "lady cats". Like, they kinda wash their faces like a cat—though not very convincingly—and there's a few good scenes with yarn, but it does feel like a bit of a lost opportunity.

The movie is lots of fun, however, and easy to riff over. I probably would have given four, maybe four and a half stars for entertainment if it weren't for the quality problems. The high pitched voices themselves were a little entertaining, but overall I'd rather have watched a standard quality version.
